Bidding data are generated for 12 Nordic bidding zones using realistic 2025 capacities and technology mixes from ENTSO-E TYNDP 2024 (Table A.1). Prices and quantities are calibrated to reflect hydro-dominant low marginal costs in NO/SE zones and gas/nuclear stability in DK/FI, with peak-hour conservatism in low-ramp zones to implicitly capture ramping costs (Brown et al., 2024). Hourly/daily injection ramping limits are enforced via zone-specific rates (300%/h for hydro, 5%/h for nuclear), and interconnector flows via group-specific limits (e.g., 1000 MW/h for FI-SE links; Nordic TSOs, 2023). Initial conditions use historical winter dispatch from Nord Pool (January 2024).
 
In the SAVLR method, the LP sub-problems will not influence the computational time. The linked block order constraints, and the exclusive group block orders are generated by Grok. In Real application, the market operator knows the relation between each block orders well. Therefore, in this algorithm, we don't separate the sub-problems completely follow the paper. But to separate them as four kinds, the elementary order, the block order, the flexible hourly order, and the network injection. The coding logic follows the pseudo code algorithm logic: 1 Initialization 2 Formulate sub-problems and check the surrogate optimality condition. 3 Combine the sub-problems and check this condition again. Note that it is necessary to shift the optimal point of the dual problem that the SAVLR method computed to another one for better pricing. The paradoxically rejected cannot be demand orders, since their bid prices are larger than all the supplier offer prices. The reason why some are equal to zero is due to some constraints, e.g. exclusive group order constraint. Given the solution of their parent order, the only feasible solution of the optimization problems of those demand orders which rejects to buy is zero. Therefore, we only show the PROs by supply orders, and how our ALD method eliminate these PROs.
